time traveller be convenient speak him expounding recondite matter us his grey eyes shone and twinkled and his usually pale face flushed and animated fire burned brightly and soft radiance incandescent lights lilies silver caught bubbles that flashed and passed our glasses our chairs being his patents embraced and caressed us rather submitted be sat upon and that luxurious dinner atmosphere thought roams gracefully free trammels precision and put us this way marking points lean forefinger as sat and lazily admired his earnestness this new paradox as thought and his fecundity must follow me carefully shall have controvert one or two ideas that almost universally accepted geometry instance taught school founded misconception that rather large thing expect us begin upon said filby argumentative person red hair do mean ask accept anything without reasonable ground soon admit as much as need know course that mathematical line line thickness nil has real existence taught that neither has mathematical plane these things mere abstractions that right said psychologist having length breadth and thickness cube have real existence object said filby course solid body may exist real things people think but wait moment instantaneous cube exist t follow said filby cube that does last time have real existence filby became pensive clearly time traveller proceeded real body must have extension four directions must have length breadth thickness and duration but natural infirmity flesh which explain moment incline overlook this fact really four dimensions three which call three planes space and fourth time however tendency draw unreal distinction former three dimensions and latter because happens that our consciousness moves intermittently one direction along latter beginning end our lives that said young man making spasmodic efforts relight his cigar lamp that clear indeed remarkable that this extensively overlooked continued time traveller slight accession cheerfulness really this what meant fourth dimension though people who talk fourth dimension do know mean another way looking time difference time and three dimensions space except that our consciousness moves along but foolish people have got hold wrong side that idea have heard what have say this fourth dimension have said provincial mayor simply this that space as our mathematicians have spoken as having three dimensions which one may call length breadth and thickness and always definable reference three planes right angles others but philosophical people have been asking three dimensions particularly another direction right angles three and have even tried construct four dimension geometry professor simon newcomb expounding this new york mathematical society month or ago know flat surface which has two dimensions represent figure three dimensional solid and similarly think that models thee dimensions could represent one four if could master perspective thing see think murmured provincial mayor and knitting his brows lapsed introspective state his lips moving as one who repeats mystic words yes think see said time brightening quite transitory manner well do mind telling have been work upon this geometry four dimensions time my results curious instance portrait man eight years old another fifteen another seventeen another twenty three and these evidently sections as were three dimensional representations his four dimensioned being which fixed and unalterable thing scientific people proceeded time traveller pause required proper assimilation this know well that time kind space popular scientific diagram weather record this line trace my finger shows movement barometer yesterday high yesterday night fell this morning rose and gently upward surely mercury did trace this line dimensions space generally recognized but certainly traced line and that line therefore must conclude along time dimension but said medical man staring hard coal fire if time really fourth dimension space and has always been regarded as something different and cannot move time as move dimensions space time traveller smiled sure move freely space right and left go backward and forward freely enough and men always have done admit move freely two dimensions but and gravitation limits us exactly said medical man balloons but balloons save spasmodic jumping and inequalities surface man had freedom vertical movement still could move little and said medical man easier far easier and cannot move time cannot get away present moment my dear sir that wrong that whole world has gone wrong always getting away present movement our mental existences which immaterial and have dimensions passing along time dimension uniform velocity cradle grave as travel if began our existence fifty miles earth s surface but great difficulty this interrupted psychologist move directions space but cannot move time that germ my great discovery but wrong say that cannot move time instance if recalling incident vividly go back instant its occurrence become absent minded as say jump back moment course have means staying back length time savage or animal has staying six feet ground but civilized man better off savage this respect go gravitation balloon and hope that ultimately may be able stop or accelerate his drift along time dimension or even turn and travel way oh this began filby said time traveller s reason said filby what reason said time traveller show black white argument said filby but never convince me possibly said time traveller but begin see object my investigations geometry four dimensions long ago had vague inkling machine travel time exclaimed young man that shall travel indifferently direction space and time as driver determines filby contented himself laughter but have experimental verification said time traveller would be remarkably convenient historian psychologist suggested one might travel back and verify accepted account battle hastings instance t think would attract attention said medical man our ancestors had great tolerance anachronisms one might get one s greek lips homer and plato young man thought which case would certainly plough little go german scholars have improved greek much future said young man think one might invest one s money leave accumulate interest and hurry ahead discover society said erected strictly communistic basis wild extravagant theories began psychologist yes seemed me and never talked until experimental verification cried going verify that experiment cried filby who getting brain weary let s see your experiment
